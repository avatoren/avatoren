- _ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @avatoren_
- I have one year of comp sci experience from the intro class I took freshman year 
- I am taking this class to learn something interesting and broaden my interests
- I am interested in playing tennis, spending time with my friends and family, and traveling 
- My goal is to make a website because last year I struggled with making one
- I am worried about the amount of work I will be given since there are so many projects but I am confident that if I prioritize the work I will get through it.
