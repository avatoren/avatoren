- __ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @avatoren__
- I _have_ one year of comp sci experience from the intro class I took freshman year 
- I am _taking_ this class to learn something interesting and broaden my interests
- I am _interested_ in playing tennis, spending time with my friends and family, and traveling 
- My _goal_ is to make a website because last year I struggled with making one
- I am _worried_ about the amount of work I will be given since there are so many projects but I am confident that if I prioritize the work I will get through it.
